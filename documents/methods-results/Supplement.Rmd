# Ocean Health Index (OHI) Global Assessment

The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a scientific framework used to measure how healthy oceans are. Understanding the state of our oceans is a first step towards ensuring they can continue providing humans benefits now and in the future. The Index describes how well we are sustainably managing 10 goals for ocean ecosystems which represent the full suite of benefits that people want and need from the ocean. These goals include: artisanal fishing opportunity, biodiversity, carbon storage, clean waters, coastal livelihoods and economies, coastal protection, food provision, natural products, sense of place, and tourism and recreation. Each goal is given a score ranging from 0 to 100, and the full suite of goal scores are then averaged to obtain an overall index score for each region. The global Ocean Health Index (OHI) assesses ocean health for 220 coastal countries and territories and has been conducted every year starting in 2012. For more information about the philosophy of the Ocean Health Index and model development see http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/. 

OHI assessments have also been completed at smaller scales. Code, training, and support is also provided for independent groups interested in leading their own OHI assessments. These are called independent OHI assessments, or “OHI+ assessments”.

# OHI+ Tetiaroa Assessment

## Project Goal

This report is a summary of the methods and results for the Tetiaroa OHI+ assessment, completed in 2020 in partnership with the Tetiaroa 4site team. The Tetiaroa OHI+ assessment uses the best-available data to measure progress toward target conditions for benefits provided by the atoll’s marine ecosystems, resulting in benefit-specific and overall health scores on a scale of 0 to 100.

## About Tetiaroa Atoll 

<center>

<br>

Tetiaroa Atoll is a group of 13 small islands located 33 miles north of Tahiti. Originally settled over 4000 years ago, it served as a retreat for Tahitian royalty, until the arrival of James Cook in 1769. Despite falling under control of the British Crown for many years thereafter, local people considered the island as sacred land. Archaeological remains of temples and platforms built can still be found on various islets.  

In the 1920s, much of the natural vegetation was removed to make way for coconut palm plantations, which remained active until **XXX**. In 1967, Tetiaroa was purchased by Marlon Brando, and remains under the ownership of his trust today. The waters around the island fall under the governance of French Polynesia. 


A luxury eco-resort was established on one of the islands, Onetahi, in 2014. Called The Brando, is it managed by Pacific Beachcomber, LLC. The resort strives to be as sustainable as possible, by minimizing visitors' impact on the natural environment and creating programs that showcase the ecology and culture of Polynesia. Revenue from the resort helps support The Tetiaroa Society, a non-profit that acts as the main environmental steward of the island, supporting visiting researchers, giving tours to resort guests, and spearheading conservation and restoration projects. 


The ecology of Tetiaroa is similar to other small islands in the South Pacific. It is surrounded by coral reefs and has additional reef structures in the lagoon, creating a highly productive and biodiverse marine environment. It is also home to 15 species of seabirds, including **XXXX**. Much of the native land vegetation has been displaced by coconut palms, although areas of **XXXX** remain on. 

Essentially all human activities that occur on Tetiaroa make use of marine resources, from recreation to research.

# Goal: Methods/Results
- Describe what the goal is measuring in the context of the OHI+ region and why this is relevant. I would also include the goals we are not including. I think the following should provide more on narrative descriptions of goals/models (vs. mathematical models and such...these are good to include, but I wouldn't use these in place of the narrative information).

## Goals Included in Tetiaroa OHI+ Assessment:
The following goals were included in the Tetiaroa OHI+ assessment:

### Biodiversity (BD)
The Biodiversity (BD) goal is made up of two subgoals, Habitats (HAB) and Species (SPP).

#### Habitats (HAB)

#### Species (SPP)

### Habitat Services (HS)
The Habitat Services (HS) goal is made up of two subgoals, Carbon Storage (CS) and Coastal Protection (CP).

####  Carbon Storage (CS)

#### Coastal Protection (CP)

### Livelihoods (LIV)

### Sense of Place (SP)
The Sense of Place (SP) goal is made up of two subgoals, Iconic Species (ICO) and Lasting Special Places (LSP).

#### Iconic Species (ICO)

#### Lasting Special Places (LSP)

To calculate a score for lasting special places on or around Tetiaroa, we adjusted the methods from what the global index uses to better reflect the long term goal of The Tetiaroa Society and its partners - to create multi-stakeholder management plans for all of Tetiaroa's land and resources. First, instead of just calculating protected area within 1km of the shore, we will treat all land areas as coastal land on Tetiaroa, since most motus (individual islands) are not wider than 1 km anyway. Second, instead of creating a buffer of 3nm and treating that as all offshore, we will split up the marine area into two categories: the lagoon area, and the area extending outwards 3nm from each motu ("offshore"). 

Lastly, we will adjust what we define as "area protected", and rather compute each areas score based on if they meet four criteria, developed through conversations with Frank Murphy and Neil Davies: 

1. Is there more than one stakeholder?
2. Is there a management plan for that area in place?
3. Does there exist some sort of monitoring or tracking of the effects of the management plan?
4. Has the management plan been effective in changing behaviors or meeting is objectives?

Below is a table listing these criteria for different management zones in Tetiaroa:  

| Zone | Multiple stakeholders | Plan? | Monitoring? | Effective? |
| :---- | :----------- | :------- | :------- | :------- |
| All motus | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| No-take zone | yes | yes | no | no |
| Rest of Lagoon | yes | yes | yes? | yes |
| 3nm offshore | no | no | no | no | no |

**Motus**

The land in Tetiaroa is privately owned by Marlon Brando's trust, which has a 99-year simple fee lease. Brando always wanted Tetiaroa to be preserved as an ecological sanctuary, and therefore helped found The Tetiaroa society to manage all conservation activities on the island. The Tetiaroa Society has worked with the trust, the government and The Brando resort to create management plans for all motus. These areas meet all four criteria.

**Lagoon No-Take Zone**. 

Half the lagoon is considered a protected "no-take zone", which is enforced by rangers employed with the Tetiaroa Society. According to the Tetiaroa Society's [sustainable use plan](https://www.tetiaroasociety.org/sites/default/files/research-docs/Tetiaroa-CASUP.pdf), this area is recognized by the Ministry for Natural Resources as of June 2014. However, Frank and Neil pointed out that while there are rangers employed, there has not been a strong monitoring effort to determine how well this area is deterring fisherman or other ecologically damaging activities. Therefore, it only meets the first two criteria. 

**Rest of the lagoon**

The Tetiaroa Society and The Brando are still involved in the management of the rest of the lagoon, so we consider this area to have multiple stakeholders. There is also technically a plan, as seasonal fishing restrictions are in place and enforced. Frank feels this enforcement is pretty effective, more so than the no-take zone, although its unclear how well the enforcement is monitored. This zone therefore meets 3 out of 4 criteria.

**Offshore**

The marine area 3 nm offshore from Tetiaroa is managed solely by the French Polynesian Government. While there exist restrictions on fishing in all FP waters (ie prohibition on shark fishing), it is unclear if there is a specific management plan. For now, we consider this area as a zero score as we cannot confirm it meets any of the four criteria. 


The final score is the average of the land, lagoon and offshore. We calculate the land score by calculating the weighted average of each motu's score, which leaves room for the score of a specific motu to change if future monitoring finds that the management plans have not been effective in things like deterring poachers or preventing introductions of native species.


### Tourism and Recreation (TR)

For the goal, we calculated a score describing sustainability of [The Brando](https://thebrando.com/) resort, the eco-resort on Onetahi. Data for this goal are descriptive sustainability metrics gathered from [SA Beachcomber's 2019 sustainability report](https://en.calameo.com/read/004500545654d0392cc93). They are all percentages (i.e. 80% energy provided by solar).

We did inquire about actual data from The Brando, contacting Alban Perret (sustainability manager). He was not able to share any data at this time, as The Brando has had to push their sustainability work to 2021. Alban said to reach out again in Q2 2021 for an update.

The Brando has already achieved far more in terms of sustainability than most resorts, so setting a reference point is tricky. They were the first resort building to receive LEED Platinum certification, and already have a very low impact. We'll assume that being 100% sustainable, i.e. have zero footprint, is a goal. While it does not seem totally feasible, the 2019 sustainability report outlines the following broad goal, which supports this reference point: 

>"Decrease carbon footprint of human activity on the island, working towards zero impact"


There are a handful of green / eco / sustainable tourism certifications out there, but one that provides a helpful framework is the [Green Destinations](https://greendestinations.org/green-destinations-standard/) certification. This certification has 100 criteria, but 3 helpful categories under the "Environment and Climate" to group the statistics from the sustainability report:

* Energy use
* Waste & Recycling
* Water management
