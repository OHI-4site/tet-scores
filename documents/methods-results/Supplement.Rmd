# Ocean Health Index (OHI) Global Assessment

The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a scientific framework used to measure how healthy oceans are. Understanding the state of our oceans is a first step towards ensuring they can continue providing humans benefits now and in the future. The Index describes how well we are sustainably managing 10 goals for ocean ecosystems which represent the full suite of benefits that people want and need from the ocean. These goals include: artisanal fishing opportunity, biodiversity, carbon storage, clean waters, coastal livelihoods and economies, coastal protection, food provision, natural products, sense of place, and tourism and recreation. Each goal is given a score ranging from 0 to 100, and the full suite of goal scores are then averaged to obtain an overall index score for each region. The global Ocean Health Index (OHI) assesses ocean health for 220 coastal countries and territories and has been conducted every year starting in 2012. For more information about the philosophy of the Ocean Health Index and model development see http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/. 

OHI assessments have also been completed at smaller scales. Code, training, and support is also provided for independent groups interested in leading their own OHI assessments. These are called independent OHI assessments, or “OHI+ assessments”.

# OHI+ Tetiaroa Assessment

## Project Goal

This report is a summary of the methods and results for the Tetiaroa OHI+ assessment, completed in 2020 in partnership with the Tetiaroa 4site team. The Tetiaroa OHI+ assessment uses the best-available data to measure progress toward target conditions for benefits provided by the atoll’s marine ecosystems, resulting in benefit-specific and overall health scores on a scale of 0 to 100.

## About Tetiaroa Atoll 

<center>
![Map of Tetiaroa Atoll](./assets/map_from_web.png)
</center>
<br>

Tetiaroa Atoll is a group of 13 small islands located 33 miles north of Tahiti. Originally settled over 4000 years ago, it served as a retreat for Tahitian royalty, until the arrival of British explorer James Cook in 1769. Despite falling under control of the British Crown for many years thereafter, local people considered the island as sacred land. Archaeological remains of temples and platforms built can still be found on various islets (called motus).  

In the 1920s, much of the natural vegetation was removed to make way for coconut palm plantations, which remained active until the early 1960s. In 1967, Tetiaroa was purchased by American actor Marlon Brando, and remains under the ownership of his trust today. The waters around the island fall under the governance of French Polynesia. 

I 2014, a luxury eco-resort was established on one of the islands, Onetahi. Called The Brando, is it managed by Pacific Beachcomber, LLC. The resort strives to be as sustainable as possible by minimizing visitors' impact on the natural environment and creating programs that showcase the ecology and culture of Polynesia. Revenue from the resort helps support The Tetiaroa Society, a non-profit that acts as the main environmental steward of the island, supporting visiting researchers, giving tours to resort guests, and spearheading conservation and restoration projects. 

The ecology of Tetiaroa is similar to other small islands in the South Pacific. It is surrounded by coral reefs and has additional reef structures in the lagoon, creating a highly productive and biodiverse marine environment. It is also home to 15 species of seabirds, including the brown booby and lesser frigate bird. Much of the native land vegetation has been displaced by coconut palms, although some of the smaller motus have intact native forest habitat.

Essentially all human activities that occur on Tetiaroa make use of marine resources, from recreation to research. Therefore, for some of the goals we consider

# Goal: Methods/Results
- Describe what the goal is measuring in the context of the OHI+ region and why this is relevant. I would also include the goals we are not including. I think the following should provide more on narrative descriptions of goals/models (vs. mathematical models and such...these are good to include, but I wouldn't use these in place of the narrative information).

## Goals Included in Tetiaroa OHI+ Assessment:
The following goals were included in the Tetiaroa OHI+ assessment:

### Biodiversity (BD)
The Biodiversity (BD) goal is made up of two subgoals, Habitats (HAB) and Species (SPP).

#### Habitats (HAB)

##### Land Habitat

For this assessment, we considered the all land areas coastal habitat, since the motus are so small and all closely linked to ocean ecosystems. Because a long term goal for Tetiaroa is to restore abandoned coconut plantation areas to native vegetation, the status score of the land habitat will be a reflection of how much native vegetation versus non native vegetation exists on the motus. 

Data used for this goal comes from a 2018 forest monitoring monitoring project undertaken by researchers from the University of French Polynesia and Oxford University (McIntosh et al., 2018) in addition to the CASUP_vegetation_flora_JYM_2015.docx found in the dropbox. Because we are not able to access the database online, these documents simply help us understand what vegetation is dominant on each motu. We will assign scores based on whether the motu is dominated by native vegetation or by coconut grove. 

To summarize, our final scoring scheme is as follows: 

**Table 4.1. Scores for Tetiaroa habitats**

| Habitat | Score
| :--------------- | :-----: |
| Only native vegetation | 1 |
| Native vegetation dominant, but some coconut grove | 0.6 |
| Coconut grove or altered landscape dominant, some vegetation | 0.3 |
| Dense coconut grove present, lacking details on native vegetation | 0 |

Each motu received a score, and with the final score calculated as the average of the motus weighted by their respective areas. 

[equation?]

##### Marine Habitat

Marine habitat that fosters biodiversity on Tetiaroa consists of the coral reefs that surround the islands and exist in the lagoon. 

#### Species (SPP)

This subgoal aims to assess the average condition of the marine species within Tetiaroa based on their IUCN status. The target for the species subgoal is to have all species at a risk status of Least Concern.

##### Current Status
Species status was calculated as the area and status-weighted average of assessed species within Tetiaroa. Marine species distribution and threat category data mostly came from IUCN Red List of Threatened Species [http://www.iucnredlist.org](http://www.iucnredlist.org). Seabird distributions data came from Birdlife International [http://datazone.birdlife.org](http://datazone.birdlife.org).   

We scaled the lower end of the biodiversity goal to be 0 when 75% species are extinct, a level comparable to the five documented mass extinctions [@barnosky_has_2011] and would constitute a catastrophic loss of biodiversity. 

Threat weights, $w_{i}$, were assigned based on the IUCN threat categories status of each $i$ species, following the weighting schemes developed by Butchart et al. [-@butchart_improvements_2007] (Table 4.2). For the purposes of this analysis, we included only data for extant species for which sufficient data were available to conduct an assessment. We did not include the Data Deficient classification as assessed species following previously published guidelines for a mid-point approach [@schipper_status_2008; @hoffmann_impact_2010].

We first calculated Tetiaroa’s area-weighted average species risk status, $\bar R_{spp}$. For each 0.5 degree grid cell within Tetiaroa, $c$, the risk status, $w$, for each species, $i$, present is summed and multiplied by cell area $A_c$, to get an area- and count-weighted species risk for each cell. This value is then divided by the sum of count-weighted area $A_c \times N_c$ across all cells within Tetiaroa. The result is the area-weighted mean species risk across Tetiaroa.

$$
\bar R_{spp} = \frac { \displaystyle\sum_{ c=1 }^{ M } \left( \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{N_c} w_i \right) \times A_c } 
                { \displaystyle\sum_{ c=1 }^{ M } A_c \times N_c },  (Eq. 4.1)
$$
To convert $\bar R_{spp}$ into a score, we set a floor at 25% (representing a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, as noted above) and then rescaled to produce a $x_{spp}$ value between zero and one.

$$
x_{spp} = max \left( \frac { \bar R_{SPP} - .25 }{ .75 }, 0 \right), (Eq. 4.2)
$$


**Table 4.2. Weights for assessment of species status based on IUCN risk categories**

| Risk Category   | IUCN code | Weight|
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| Extinct         |     EX    |  0.0  |
| Critically Endangered | CR  |  0.2  |
| Endangered      |     EN    |  0.4  |
| Vulnerable      |     VU    |  0.6  |
| Near Threatened |     NT    |  0.8  |
| Least Concern   |     LC    |  1.0  |


##### Trend
We calculate trend using data the IUCN provides for current and past assessments of species, which we use to estimate annual change in IUCN risk status for each species.  We then summarize these species trend values for Tetiaroa using the same general approach used to calculate status.

### Coastal Protection (CP)

*Note to Laura: I probably can't add this until I talk with Gage about coral data*

### Conservation Economy (CE)

The global OHI includes a measure of the jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries, called the Livelihoods and Economies (LE) goal. Marine-related industries are clearly of huge value to many people, even those who do not directly participate in the industries but value community identity, tax revenue, and indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy. This goal is composed of two equally important sub-goals, livelihoods and economies, which are assessed across as many marine-related sectors as possible. Livelihoods includes two equally important sub-components, the number of jobs, which is a proxy for livelihood quantity, and the per capita average annual wages, which is a proxy for job quality. Economies is composed of a single component, revenue

For Tetiaroa, we are modifying this model to include only one goal caputuring the revenue generated by the Tetiaroa Society, which we are calling the Conservation Economy (CE). We felt that including all measures of LE made less sense, as there are very few full time residents on the island, and all of them are employed by The Brando or the Tetiaroa Society. Essentially all of the Tetiaroa Society's activities and expenditures are related to environmental and cultural conservation of the island, which is why we refer to this goal in this context as "Conservation Economy". Also, because a portion of the Tetiaroa Society's income comes from guest fees at the resort, there is a direct link between a healthy ocean or island environment that attracts tourism, and generating the funds necessary to help preserve it. 

We used the Tetiaroa's Society fundraising goal as the reference point, which breaks down as follows:

| Item | Yearly Cost | Description | 
| :------- | :--------: | :------------ |
| Operations | $700 K | Covers core staff and facilities maintenance / depreciation | 
| **Mission Programs:** |       |          |
| Conservation & Sustainable Use Plan | $ 250 K 
| Social-Ecological System Observatory | $750 K | Monitoring CASUP, data management, and establishing baselines for science |
| Science Programs | $100 K | Seed grants, equipment, meetings, workshops |
| Cultural and Educational Programs | $100 K |       |
| Blue Climate Initiative | $100 K |       |

**Total Yearly Budget** = $2,000,000 

To measure the status of this goal, we used the 2018 and 2019 Tetiaroa Society reports for income in 2018 and 2019, and then a measure of $700,000 per year for 2020 (per Neil and Frank's estimation):

$$
x_{ce} = avg \left( \frac { \bar I_{yr}}{ G_{yr} }) 
$$

Where $I_{yr}$ is the yearly income and $G_{yr}$ is the yearly fundraising goal. 

##### Trend

The trend for this goal was calculated using only the three years of data we have available, rather than the usual five.

##### Data
_Status and trend_

#data_layers(goal="SPP", dimension=c("status", "trend"))

#data_layers(goal="SPP", dimension=c("pressure"))
```

_Resilience_

```{r CE r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
#data_layers(goal="SPP", dimension=c("resilience"))
```



### Sense of Place (SP). 

The Sense of Place (SP) goal attempts to capture the aspects of Tetiaroa's coastal and marine system that people value as part of their cultural identity. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from knowing particular places or species exist. This goal is calculated using two equally weighted subgoals: iconic species (ICO) and lasting special places (LSP).

#### Iconic Species (ICO). 

Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through their relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales). Ultimately, almost any species can be iconic to someone, and so the intent with this goal was to focus on those species widely seen as iconic from a cultural or existence value (rather than a livelihoods or extractive reason). Habitat-forming species were not included, nor were species harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual).

The Iconic Species subgoal aims to assess the conservation status of species that have particular value to Tetiaroa. We decided that for this assessment, our iconic species list would be the list of species highlighted on the [Tetiaroa Society's website](https://www.tetiaroasociety.org/index.php/island).


##### Current Status
After compiling a list of species from this source, we pulled its conservation status using the IUCN RRedlist package and then assigned each species a score based on its conservation status. The overall score is determined by finding the average score per species class, and then taking the overall average among the classes. The table below shows how each IUCN conservation status is scored: 

**Table 4.2. Weights for assessment of species status based on IUCN risk categories**

| Risk Category   | IUCN code | Weight|
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| Extinct         |     EX    |  0.0  |
| Critically Endangered | CR  |  0.2  |
| Endangered      |     EN    |  0.4  |
| Vulnerable      |     VU    |  0.6  |
| Near Threatened |     NT    |  0.8  |
| Least Concern   |     LC    |  1.0  |


##### Trend
We calculated trend using data the IUCN provides for current and past assessments of species, which we used to create a time series of average risk status for species within Tetiaroa. Because IUCN assessments are generally infrequent for any given species, we derive the trend as the annual change in risk status for each species across the previous twenty years, rather than a five-year window typical of other goals, and include only taxa with two or more IUCN assessments within the past 20 years.

##### Data

#data_layers(goal="ICO", dimension=c("pressure"))
```

_Resilience_

```{r ICO r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
#data_layers(goal="ICO", dimension=c("resilience"))
```


#### Lasting Special Places (LSP)

The methods for the global OHI assessment use the extent of areas protected as a way to measure the aesthetic, spiritual, and cultural value people hold for a certain place. The model for this goal considers the inland coastal zone (up to 1 km inland) independently from, and equally weighted with, the offshore coastal zone (up to 3 nm offshore).  The status for this goal is calculated as:  

<br>

$$X_{LSP} = \frac{\left(\frac{Area_{P}}{Area_{P_{ref}}} + \frac{Area_{MPA}}{Area_{MPA_{ref}}}\right)}{2}$$

where: 

* $Area_{P}$ = Protected area for inland 1 km buffer
* ${Area_{P_{ref}}}$ = Reference value for inland protected area
* $Area_{MPA}$ = Marine protected area for offshore 3 nm buffer
* ${Area_{MPA_{ref}}}$ = Reference value for marine protected area within offshore 3 nm buffer
* $Ref$ = 30% of total area within buffer zone is protected
  
    
<br>

Because Tetiaroa is such a small area, we will adjust these methods. First, instead of just calculating protected area within 1km of the shore, we will treat all land areas as coastal land on Tetiaroa, since most motus (individual islands) are not wider than 1 km anyway. Second, instead of creating a buffer of 3nm and treating that as all offshore, we will split up the marine area into two categories: the lagoon area, and the area extending outwards 3nm from each motu ("offshore"). 

Lastly, we will adjust what we define as "area protected", computing a score for each zone based on if they meet four criteria, developed through conversations with Frank Murphy and Neil Davies: 

1. Is there more than one stakeholder?
2. Is there a management plan for that area in place?
3. Does there exist some sort of monitoring or tracking of the effects of the management plan?
4. Has the management plan been effective in changing behaviors or meeting is objectives?

Below is a table listing these criteria for different management zones in Tetiaroa, with a 1 indicating this criteria is being fulfilled to the best extent, and a 0 indicating that a criteria does not exist at all:  

| Zone | Multiple Stakeholders? | Plan? | Monitoring? | Effective? |
| :---- | :----------- | :------- | :------- | :------- |
| All motus | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| No-take zone | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0.75 |
| Rest of Lagoon | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 3nm offshore | 0 | 0.5 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

**Motus**

The land in Tetiaroa is privately owned by Marlon Brando's trust, which has a 99-year simple fee lease. Brando always wanted Tetiaroa to be preserved as an ecological sanctuary, and therefore helped found The Tetiaroa society to manage all conservation activities on the island. The Tetiaroa Society has worked with the trust, the government and The Brando resort to create management plans for all motus. These areas meet all four criteria.

**Lagoon No-Take Zone**. 

Half the lagoon is considered a protected "no-take zone", which is enforced by rangers employed with the Tetiaroa Society. According to the Tetiaroa Society's [sustainable use plan](https://www.tetiaroasociety.org/sites/default/files/research-docs/Tetiaroa-CASUP.pdf), this area is recognized by the Ministry for Natural Resources as of June 2014. However, Frank and Neil pointed out that while there are rangers employed, the monitoring effort has not helped to determine how well this area is deterring fisherman or other ecologically damaging activities. Therefore, it meets with first three criteria and scores a 0.75 in its effectiveness. 

**Rest of the lagoon**

The Tetiaroa Society and The Brando are still involved in the management of the rest of the lagoon, so we consider this area to have multiple stakeholders. There is also technically a plan, as seasonal fishing restrictions are in place and enforced. Frank feels this enforcement is pretty effective, more so than the no-take zone. This zone therefore meets 4 out of 4 criteria.

**Offshore**

The marine area 3 nm offshore from Tetiaroa is managed solely by the French Polynesian Government. While there exist restrictions on fishing in all FP waters (ie year-round prohibitions on shark fishing), there does not seem to exist a comprehensive management plan for pelagic ecosystems, so we'll score this criteria as 0.5. Because the existing "management plan" is very simple, Frank and Neil feel that it is being enforced well, even if it is not monitored well. This might seem counterintuitive, but it may be that fishers and visitors are adhering to the restrictions more because violation can result in a large fine and possible jail time, acting a strong deterrent despite a lack of monitoring.

##### Current status 
The status score will be the average of the land, lagoon and offshore. We will calculate the land score by calculating the weighted average of each motu's score, which leaves room for the score of a specific motu to change if future monitoring finds that the management plans have not been effective in things like deterring poachers or preventing introductions of native species.

##### Trend

This management scheme has not changed since 2014, when The Brando opened. Therefore, the trend for this score is zero.

### Tourism and Recreation (TR)

For the goal, we calculated a score describing sustainability of [The Brando](https://thebrando.com/) resort, the eco-resort on Onetahi. Data for this goal are descriptive sustainability metrics gathered from [SA Beachcomber's 2019 sustainability report](https://en.calameo.com/read/004500545654d0392cc93). They are all percentages (i.e. 80% energy provided by solar).

We did inquire about actual data from The Brando, contacting Alban Perret (sustainability manager). He was not able to share any data at this time, as The Brando has had to push their sustainability work to 2021. Alban said to reach out again in Q2 2021 for an update.

The Brando has already achieved far more in terms of sustainability than most resorts, so setting a reference point is tricky. They were the first resort building to receive LEED Platinum certification, and already have a very low impact. We'll assume that being 100% sustainable, i.e. have zero footprint, is a goal. While it does not seem totally feasible, the 2019 sustainability report outlines the following broad goal, which supports this reference point: 

>"Decrease carbon footprint of human activity on the island, working towards zero impact"


There are a handful of green / eco / sustainable tourism certifications out there, but one that provides a helpful framework is the [Green Destinations](https://greendestinations.org/green-destinations-standard/) certification. This certification has 100 criteria, but 3 helpful categories under the "Environment and Climate" to group the statistics from the sustainability report:

* Energy use
* Waste & Recycling
* Water management

##### Current Status

For this goal, we will score each sustainability category based on two criteria: 

1. How close it is to 100% sustainable, or zero impact?
2. Is this category being closely monitored?

If the answer to the second criteria is "no", the score will be reduced by 0.5.

Based on our limited information, we believe that energy and waste meet both these criteria, while water does not. Furthermore, it is unclear how much water sourced from non-native freshwater is actually being used, so its difficult to give this category a score. If a category has multiple metrics, those will be averaged to get the category score. We will then average the three category scores to get the final score.

##### Trend

Since we only have the Sustainability Report for 2019, we do not know at this time if any of these measures has changed since 2014 (when the resort opened). For now, the trend will be zero, but with more detailed data can be updated.

## Goals Not Included:

The following goals that are typically included in the OHI global assessment were not included in the Tetiaroa OHI+ assessment:

### Carbon Storage (CS)

The Carbon Storage goal measures the health of carbon storing habitats. Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems (e.g., mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds) have substantially larger areal carbon burial rates than terrestrial forests, and "Blue Carbon" has been suggested as an alternate, more manageable carbon sequestration approach. The rapid destruction of these coastal habitats may release large amounts of buried carbon back into the ocean-atmosphere system. Our focus here, therefore, is on coastal habitats because they are threatened, have large amounts of stored carbon that would rapidly be released with further habitat destruction, have the highest per-area sequestration rates of any habitat on the planet, and are amenable to management, conservation, and restoration efforts. We refer to this goal as carbon storage but intend its meaning to include sequestration.

[Explanation of why it wasn't included]

### Clean Waters (CW)

People value marine waters that are free of pollution and debris for aesthetic and health reasons. Contamination of waters comes from oil spills, chemicals, eutrophication, algal blooms, disease pathogens (e.g., fecal coliform, viruses, and parasites from sewage outflow), floating trash, and mass kills of organisms due to pollution. People are sensitive to these phenomena occurring in areas they access for recreation or other purposes as well as for simply knowing that clean waters exist. This goal scores highest when the contamination level is zero.

[Explanation of why it wasn't included]

### Food Provision (FP)

The Food Provision (FP) goal is made up of two subgoals, Fisheries (FIS) and Mariculture (MAR).

One of the most fundamental services the ocean provides people is the provision of seafood. The Food Provision goal measures the amount of seafood sustainably harvested within an EEZ or region through any means for use primarily in human consumption and thus includes wild-caught commercial fisheries, mariculture, and artisanal-scale and recreational fisheries. 

[Explanation of why it wasn't included] 

#### Fisheries (FIS)

The Fisheries subgoal aims to assess the amount of wild-caught seafood that can be sustainably harvested. 

[Explanation of why it wasn't included]

#### Mariculture (MAR)

The Mariculture subgoal attempts to measure a region's food production from mariculture relative to its capacity.  

[Explanation of why it wasn't included]

### Artisanal Fishing Opportunity (AO)

Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation, and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations (Allison & Ellis 2001). Artisanal fishing refers to fisheries involving households, cooperatives, or small firms (as opposed to large, commercial companies) that use relatively small amounts of capital and energy and small fishing vessels (if any), make relatively short fishing trips, and use fish mainly for local consumption or trade. 

[Explanation of why it wasn't included]  

### Natural Products (NP)

In many countries the harvest of non-food natural products is important for local economies and can also be traded internationally. The sustainable harvest of these products is therefore an important component of a healthy ocean. This goal assesses the ability of countries to maximize the sustainable harvest of living marine resources, such as corals, shells, seaweeds, and fish for the aquarium trade. 

This type of harvesting of natural products for sale or trade does not occur on Tetiaroa and therefore is not included in this OHI+ assessment.   

### Livelihoods & Economies (LE)

The Livelihoods & Economies (LE) goal is made up of two subgoals, Livelihoods (LIV) and Economies (ECO). While LIV was included as a goal in the Tetiaroa OHI+ assessment, ECO was not.

The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries are clearly of huge value to many people, even those who do not directly participate in the industries but value community identity, tax revenue, and indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy. This goal measures both livelihood quantity and job quality.   

#### Economies (ECO)
