# Ocean Health Index (OHI) Global Assessment

The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a scientific framework used to measure how healthy oceans are. Understanding the state of our oceans is a first step towards ensuring they can continue providing humans benefits now and in the future. The Index describes how well we are sustainably managing 10 goals for ocean ecosystems which represent the full suite of benefits that people want and need from the ocean. These goals include: artisanal fishing opportunity, biodiversity, carbon storage, clean waters, coastal livelihoods and economies, coastal protection, food provision, natural products, sense of place, and tourism and recreation. Each goal is given a score ranging from 0 to 100, and the full suite of goal scores are then averaged to obtain an overall index score for each region. The global Ocean Health Index (OHI) assesses ocean health for 220 coastal countries and territories and has been conducted every year starting in 2012. For more information about the philosophy of the Ocean Health Index and model development see http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/. 

OHI assessments have also been completed at smaller scales. Code, training, and support is also provided for independent groups interested in leading their own OHI assessments. These are called independent OHI assessments, or “OHI+ assessments”.

# OHI+ Tetiaroa Assessment

## Project Goal

This report is a summary of the methods and results for the Tetiaroa OHI+ assessment, completed in 2020 in partnership with the Tetiaroa 4site team. The Tetiaroa OHI+ assessment uses the best-available data to measure progress toward target conditions for benefits provided by the atoll’s marine ecosystems, resulting in benefit-specific and overall health scores on a scale of 0 to 100.

## About Tetiaroa Atoll 

<center>
![Map of Tetiaroa Atoll](./assets/map_from_web.png)
</center>
<br>

Tetiaroa Atoll is a group of 13 small islands located 33 miles north of Tahiti. Originally settled over 4000 years ago, it served as a retreat for Tahitian royalty, until the arrival of James Cook in 1769. Despite falling under control of the British Crown for many years thereafter, local people considered the island as sacred land. Archaeological remains of temples and platforms built can still be found on various islets.  

In the 1920s, much of the natural vegetation was removed to make way for coconut palm plantations, which remained active until the early 1960s. In 1967, Tetiaroa was purchased by American actor Marlon Brando, and remains under the ownership of his trust today. The waters around the island fall under the governance of French Polynesia. 


A luxury eco-resort was established on one of the islands, Onetahi, in 2014. Called The Brando, is it managed by Pacific Beachcomber, LLC. The resort strives to be as sustainable as possible by minimizing visitors' impact on the natural environment and creating programs that showcase the ecology and culture of Polynesia. Revenue from the resort helps support The Tetiaroa Society, a non-profit that acts as the main environmental steward of the island, supporting visiting researchers, giving tours to resort guests, and spearheading conservation and restoration projects. 

The ecology of Tetiaroa is similar to other small islands in the South Pacific. It is surrounded by coral reefs and has additional reef structures in the lagoon, creating a highly productive and biodiverse marine environment. It is also home to 15 species of seabirds, including **XXXX**. Much of the native land vegetation has been displaced by coconut palms, although areas of **XXXX** remain on. 

Essentially all human activities that occur on Tetiaroa make use of marine resources, from recreation to research.

# Goal: Methods/Results
- Describe what the goal is measuring in the context of the OHI+ region and why this is relevant. I would also include the goals we are not including. I think the following should provide more on narrative descriptions of goals/models (vs. mathematical models and such...these are good to include, but I wouldn't use these in place of the narrative information).

## Goals Included in Tetiaroa OHI+ Assessment:
The following goals were included in the Tetiaroa OHI+ assessment:

### Biodiversity (BD)
The Biodiversity (BD) goal is made up of two subgoals, Habitats (HAB) and Species (SPP).

#### Habitats (HAB)

##### Land Habitat

For this assessment, we considered the all land areas coastal habitat, since the motus are so small and all closely linked to ocean ecosystems. Because a long term goal for Tetiaroa is to restore abandoned coconut plantation areas to native vegetation, the status score of the land habitat will be a reflection of how much native vegetation versus non native vegetation exists on the motus. 

Data used for this goal comes from a 2018 forest monitoring monitoring project undertaken by researchers from the University of French Polynesia and Oxford University (McIntosh et al., 2018) in addition to the CASUP_vegetation_flora_JYM_2015.docx found in the dropbox. Because we are not able to access the database online, these documents simply help us understand what vegetation is dominant on each motu. We will assign scores based on whether the motu is dominated by native vegetation or by coconut grove. 

To summarize, our final scoring scheme is as follows: 

**Table 4.1. Scores for Tetiaroa habitats**

| Habitat | Score
| :--------------- | :-----: |
| Only native vegetation | 1 |
| Native vegetation dominant, but some coconut grove | 0.6 |
| Coconut grove or altered landscape dominant, some vegetation | 0.3 |
| Dense coconut grove present, lacking details on native vegetation | 0 |

Each motu received a score, and with the final score calculated as the average of the motus weighted by their respective areas.

#### Species (SPP)

This subgoal aims to assess the average condition of the marine species within Tetiaroa based on their IUCN status. The target for the species subgoal is to have all species at a risk status of Least Concern.

##### Current Status
Species status was calculated as the area and status-weighted average of assessed species within Tetiaroa. Marine species distribution and threat category data mostly came from IUCN Red List of Threatened Species [http://www.iucnredlist.org](http://www.iucnredlist.org). Seabird distributions data came from Birdlife International [http://datazone.birdlife.org](http://datazone.birdlife.org).   

We scaled the lower end of the biodiversity goal to be 0 when 75% species are extinct, a level comparable to the five documented mass extinctions [@barnosky_has_2011] and would constitute a catastrophic loss of biodiversity. 

Threat weights, $w_{i}$, were assigned based on the IUCN threat categories status of each $i$ species, following the weighting schemes developed by Butchart et al. [-@butchart_improvements_2007] (Table 4.2). For the purposes of this analysis, we included only data for extant species for which sufficient data were available to conduct an assessment. We did not include the Data Deficient classification as assessed species following previously published guidelines for a mid-point approach [@schipper_status_2008; @hoffmann_impact_2010].

We first calculated Tetiaroa’s area-weighted average species risk status, $\bar R_{spp}$. For each 0.5 degree grid cell within Tetiaroa, $c$, the risk status, $w$, for each species, $i$, present is summed and multiplied by cell area $A_c$, to get an area- and count-weighted species risk for each cell. This value is then divided by the sum of count-weighted area $A_c \times N_c$ across all cells within Tetiaroa. The result is the area-weighted mean species risk across Tetiaroa.

$$
\bar R_{spp} = \frac { \displaystyle\sum_{ c=1 }^{ M } \left( \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{N_c} w_i \right) \times A_c } 
                { \displaystyle\sum_{ c=1 }^{ M } A_c \times N_c },  (Eq. 4.1)
$$
To convert $\bar R_{spp}$ into a score, we set a floor at 25% (representing a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, as noted above) and then rescaled to produce a $x_{spp}$ value between zero and one.

$$
x_{spp} = max \left( \frac { \bar R_{SPP} - .25 }{ .75 }, 0 \right), (Eq. 4.2)
$$


**Table 4.2. Weights for assessment of species status based on IUCN risk categories**

| Risk Category   | IUCN code | Weight|
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| Extinct         |     EX    |  0.0  |
| Critically Endangered | CR  |  0.2  |
| Endangered      |     EN    |  0.4  |
| Vulnerable      |     VU    |  0.6  |
| Near Threatened |     NT    |  0.8  |
| Least Concern   |     LC    |  1.0  |


##### Trend
We calculate trend using data the IUCN provides for current and past assessments of species, which we use to estimate annual change in IUCN risk status for each species.  We then summarize these species trend values for Tetiaroa using the same general approach used to calculate status.

##### Data

```


### Habitat Services (HS)
The Habitat Services (HS) goal is made up of two subgoals, Carbon Storage (CS) and Coastal Protection (CP).

####  Carbon Storage (CS)

#### Coastal Protection (CP)

### Conservation Economy (CE)

### Sense of Place (SP). 

The Sense of Place (SP) goal attempts to capture the aspects of Tetiaroa's coastal and marine system that people value as part of their cultural identity. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from knowing particular places or species exist. This goal is calculated using two equally weighted subgoals: iconic species (ICO) and lasting special places (LSP).

#### Iconic Species (ICO). 

Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through their relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales). Ultimately, almost any species can be iconic to someone, and so the intent with this goal was to focus on those species widely seen as iconic from a cultural or existence value (rather than a livelihoods or extractive reason). Habitat-forming species were not included, nor were species harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual).

The Iconic Species subgoal aims to assess the conservation status of species that have particular value to Tetiaroa. We decided that for this assessment, our iconic species list would be the list of species highlighted on the [Tetiaroa Society's website](https://www.tetiaroasociety.org/index.php/island).

##### Current Status
After compiling a list of species from this source, we pulled its conservation status using the IUCN RRedlist package and then assigned each species a score based on its conservation status. The overall score is determined by finding the average score per species class, and then taking the overall average among the classes. The table below shows how each IUCN conservation status is scored: 

[insert table]


##### Trend
We calculated trend using data the IUCN provides for current and past assessments of species, which we used to create a time series of average risk status for species within Tetiaroa. Because IUCN assessments are generally infrequent for any given species, we derive the trend as the annual change in risk status for each species across the previous twenty years, rather than a five-year window typical of other goals, and include only taxa with two or more IUCN assessments within the past 20 years.

##### Data
_Status and trend_

```{r ICO data st, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
data_layers(goal="ICO", dimension=c("status", "trend"))
```

_Pressure_

```{r ICO data p, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
data_layers(goal="ICO", dimension=c("pressure"))
```

_Resilience_

```{r ICO r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
data_layers(goal="ICO", dimension=c("resilience"))
```


#### Lasting Special Places (LSP)

To calculate a score for lasting special places on or around Tetiaroa, we adjusted the methods from what the global index uses to better reflect the long term goal of The Tetiaroa Society and its partners - to create multi-stakeholder management plans for all of Tetiaroa's land and resources. First, instead of just calculating protected area within 1km of the shore, we will treat all land areas as coastal land on Tetiaroa, since most motus (individual islands) are not wider than 1 km anyway. Second, instead of creating a buffer of 3nm and treating that as all offshore, we will split up the marine area into two categories: the lagoon area, and the area extending outwards 3nm from each motu ("offshore"). 

Lastly, we will adjust what we define as "area protected", and rather compute each areas score based on if they meet four criteria, developed through conversations with Frank Murphy and Neil Davies: 

1. Is there more than one stakeholder?
2. Is there a management plan for that area in place?
3. Does there exist some sort of monitoring or tracking of the effects of the management plan?
4. Has the management plan been effective in changing behaviors or meeting is objectives?

Below is a table listing these criteria for different management zones in Tetiaroa:  

| Zone | Multiple stakeholders | Plan? | Monitoring? | Effective? |
| :---- | :----------- | :------- | :------- | :------- |
| All motus | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| No-take zone | yes | yes | no | no |
| Rest of Lagoon | yes | yes | yes? | yes |
| 3nm offshore | no | no | no | no | no |

**Motus**

The land in Tetiaroa is privately owned by Marlon Brando's trust, which has a 99-year simple fee lease. Brando always wanted Tetiaroa to be preserved as an ecological sanctuary, and therefore helped found The Tetiaroa society to manage all conservation activities on the island. The Tetiaroa Society has worked with the trust, the government and The Brando resort to create management plans for all motus. These areas meet all four criteria.

**Lagoon No-Take Zone**. 

Half the lagoon is considered a protected "no-take zone", which is enforced by rangers employed with the Tetiaroa Society. According to the Tetiaroa Society's [sustainable use plan](https://www.tetiaroasociety.org/sites/default/files/research-docs/Tetiaroa-CASUP.pdf), this area is recognized by the Ministry for Natural Resources as of June 2014. However, Frank and Neil pointed out that while there are rangers employed, there has not been a strong monitoring effort to determine how well this area is deterring fisherman or other ecologically damaging activities. Therefore, it only meets the first two criteria. 

**Rest of the lagoon**

The Tetiaroa Society and The Brando are still involved in the management of the rest of the lagoon, so we consider this area to have multiple stakeholders. There is also technically a plan, as seasonal fishing restrictions are in place and enforced. Frank feels this enforcement is pretty effective, more so than the no-take zone, although its unclear how well the enforcement is monitored. This zone therefore meets 3 out of 4 criteria.

**Offshore**

The marine area 3 nm offshore from Tetiaroa is managed solely by the French Polynesian Government. While there exist restrictions on fishing in all FP waters (ie prohibition on shark fishing), it is unclear if there is a specific management plan. For now, we consider this area as a zero score as we cannot confirm it meets any of the four criteria. 


The final score is the average of the land, lagoon and offshore. We calculate the land score by calculating the weighted average of each motu's score, which leaves room for the score of a specific motu to change if future monitoring finds that the management plans have not been effective in things like deterring poachers or preventing introductions of native species.


### Tourism and Recreation (TR)

For the goal, we calculated a score describing sustainability of [The Brando](https://thebrando.com/) resort, the eco-resort on Onetahi. Data for this goal are descriptive sustainability metrics gathered from [SA Beachcomber's 2019 sustainability report](https://en.calameo.com/read/004500545654d0392cc93). They are all percentages (i.e. 80% energy provided by solar).

We did inquire about actual data from The Brando, contacting Alban Perret (sustainability manager). He was not able to share any data at this time, as The Brando has had to push their sustainability work to 2021. Alban said to reach out again in Q2 2021 for an update.

The Brando has already achieved far more in terms of sustainability than most resorts, so setting a reference point is tricky. They were the first resort building to receive LEED Platinum certification, and already have a very low impact. We'll assume that being 100% sustainable, i.e. have zero footprint, is a goal. While it does not seem totally feasible, the 2019 sustainability report outlines the following broad goal, which supports this reference point: 

>"Decrease carbon footprint of human activity on the island, working towards zero impact"


There are a handful of green / eco / sustainable tourism certifications out there, but one that provides a helpful framework is the [Green Destinations](https://greendestinations.org/green-destinations-standard/) certification. This certification has 100 criteria, but 3 helpful categories under the "Environment and Climate" to group the statistics from the sustainability report:

* Energy use
* Waste & Recycling
* Water management
